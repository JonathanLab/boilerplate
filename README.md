## Forms Boilerplate

Boilerplate code for a form with input components, built using Typescript NextJS and react-hook-forms.

Currently supported inputs are:

- Numbers
- Dates
- Checkboxes

Todo:

- Add schema validation using [zod](zod.dev) or [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
- Add easily extendable classnames to all components using clsx
- Add more html properties to existing input components
- Possibly combine all input components into one overlapping component
- Use a custom date picker instead of the default one provided by browsers.
